# Development Logs
Summary file for any and all work that is done on this project. Separated by dates and progress made on the project. 
Overarching goals:
1. Use AS LITTLE generative AI as possible. When used, will be noted in the dev logs. 

    Reasoning: Due to how fast AI is moving, would like to build a project that I can say I built from scratch. Additionally, partially trying a new language without any assistance might be refreshing. 

2. Use VIM. Currently running a VIM extension in VSCode, and wanting to brush up on those skills that were trained prior to the addiction to VSCode that commenced.
3. Learn C++. This isn't going to be a crash course on C++, but at the very least I want to be able to say that I have some exposure to the language. 

    Reasoning: I've used Rust for Senior Design project, been trained in C for far too long, so want to take advantage of the more flexible scope (and hopefully not too complicated project) to build it in C++.   

## 4/6 
- Built a hello world program in C++ (wow, for the millionth time). 
- Tested passing in arguments to C++ program. 
- Built foundational framework (Makefile, etc). 
- Tested to determine if the user entered server or client (needed standard library and string library)
- Got a decent workflow of client and server from the main function (better to start earlier than later)
